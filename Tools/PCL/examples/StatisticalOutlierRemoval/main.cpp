/*
 * Laser scans typically generate point cloud datasets of varying point densities.
 * Additionally, measurement errors lead to sparse outliers which corrupt the results even more.
 * This complicates the estimation of local point cloud characteristics such as surface normals or curvature changes,
 * leading to erroneous values, which in turn might cause point cloud registration failures.
 * Some of these irregularities can be solved by performing a statistical analysis on each pointâ€™s neighborhood,
 * and trimming those which do not meet a certain criterion.
 * Our sparse outlier removal is based on the computation of the distribution of point to neighbors distances in the input dataset.
 * For each point, we compute the mean distance from it to all its neighbors.
 * By assuming that the resulted distribution is Gaussian with a mean and a standard deviation,
 * all points whose mean distances are outside an interval defined by the global distances mean
 * and standard deviation can be considered as outliers and trimmed from the dataset.
