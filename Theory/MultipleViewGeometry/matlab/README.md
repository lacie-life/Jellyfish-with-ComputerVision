# matlab scripts

For some of these functions you will need to have the [Symbolic Math Toolbox](https://www.mathworks.com/products/symbolic.html) installed.

I wrote these scripts quickly and didn't add input checks for most of them. Feel free to adjust them.

The scripts starting with `app_*` contain examples or boilerplates I created in order to iterate quickly in the exam.
