The files `model.py`, `actor.py` and `train-self-driving-agent.ipynb` are given as reference in this repository, but these will not work without `carla_gym` library. Hence it is recommended to follow below steps as the library will come preinstalled in the below repository

1. Clone [https://github.com/sizhky/gym-carla](https://github.com/sizhky/gym-carla)
2. Ensure all requirements are installed as per the readme instructions from the above repository
3. Run [drive-car.ipynb](https://github.com/sizhky/gym-carla/blob/main/drive-car.ipynb) to see a working demo of a sample model given in the repo
4. Open [train-self-driving-agent.ipynb](https://github.com/sizhky/gym-carla/blob/main/train-self-driving-agent.ipynb) to 
train the self driving agent furthermore, or tweak teh configuration settings and train your own agent
