# Camera Mechanism

In this tutorial, we will discuss some of the basic camera concepts, like aperture, shutter, shutter speed, ISO and we will discuss the collective use of these concepts to capture a good image.

## Aperture

Aperture is a small opening which allows the light to travel inside into camera. Here is the picture of aperture.

You will see some small blades like stuff inside the aperture. These blades create a octagonal shape that can be opened closed. And thus it make sense that, the more blades will open, the hole from which the light would have to pass would be bigger. The bigger the hole, the more light is allowed to enter.

### Effect 

The effect of the aperture directly corresponds to brightness and darkness of an image. If the aperture opening is wide, it would allow more light to pass into the camera. More light would result in more photons, which ultimately result in a brighter image.

The example of this is shown below
