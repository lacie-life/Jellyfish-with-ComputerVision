# Concept of Bits Per Pixel

Bpp or bits per pixel denotes the number of bits per pixel. The number of different colors in an image is depends on the depth of color or bits per pixel.

## Bits in mathematics

Its just like playing with binary bits.

How many numbers can be represented by one bit.

0

1

How many two bits combinations can be made.

00

01

10

11

If we devise a formula for the calculation of total number of combinations that can be made from bit, it would be like this.

bits per pixels
Where bpp denotes bits per pixel. Put 1 in the formula you get 2, put 2 in the formula, you get 4. It grows exponentially.

## Number of differnt colors

Now as we said it in the beginning, that the number of different colors depend on the number of bits per pixel.

The table for some of the bits and their color is given below.

|Bits per pixel|Number of colors|
|-------------|-----------------|
|1 bpp|2 colors|
|2 bpp|4 colors|
|4 bpp|8 colors|
|5 bpp|32 colors|
|6 bpp|64 colors|
|7 bpp|128 colors|
|8 bpp|256 colors|
|10 bpp|1024 colors|
|16 bpp|65536 colors|
|24 bpp|16777216 colors (16.7 million colors)|
|32 bpp|4294967296 colors (4294 million colors)|

This table shows different bits per pixel and the amount of color they contain.
