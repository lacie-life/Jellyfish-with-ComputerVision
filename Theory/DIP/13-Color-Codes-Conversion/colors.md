# Color Codes Conversion

In this tutorial, we will see that how different color codes can be combined to make other colors, and how we can covert RGB color codes to hex and vice versa.

## Different color codes

All the colors here are of the 24 bit format, that means each color has 8 bits of red, 8 bits of green, 8 bits of blue, in it. Or we can say each color has three different portions. You just have to change the quantity of these three portions to make any color.

## CMYK color model

CMYK is another color model where c stands for cyan, m stands for magenta, y stands for yellow, and k for black. CMYK model is commonly used in color printers in which there are two carters of color is used. One consist of CMY and other consist of black color.

The colors of CMY can also made from changing the quantity or portion of red, green and blue.
