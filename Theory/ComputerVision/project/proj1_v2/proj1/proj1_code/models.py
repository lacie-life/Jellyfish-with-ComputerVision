  def get_kernel(self, cutoff_frequency: int) -> torch.Tensor:
    """
    Returns a Gaussian kernel using the specified cutoff frequency.

    PyTorch requires the kernel to be of a particular shape in order to apply
    it to an image. Specifically, the kernel needs to be of shape (c, 1, k, k)
    where c is the # channels in the image. Start by getting a 2D Gaussian
    kernel using your implementation from Part 1, which will be of shape
    (k, k). Then, let's say you have an RGB image, you will need to turn this
    into a Tensor of shape (3, 1, k, k) by stacking the Gaussian kernel 3
    times.

    Args
    - cutoff_frequency: int specifying cutoff_frequency
    Returns
    - kernel: Tensor of shape (c, 1, k, k) where c is # channels

    HINTS:
    - You will use the create_Gaussian_kernel() function from part1.py in this
      function.
    - Since the # channels may differ across each image in the dataset, make
      sure you don't hardcode the dimensions you reshape the kernel to. There
      is a variable defined in this class to give you channel information.
    - You can use np.reshape() to change the dimensions of a numpy array.
    - You can use np.tile() to repeat a numpy array along specified axes.
    - You can use torch.Tensor() to convert numpy arrays to torch Tensors.

      convolution function you should use here!).
    - Pass self.n_channels as the value to the "groups" parameter of the
      convolution function. This represents the # of channels that the filter
      will be applied to.

      this function.
    - Similar to Part 1, you can get just the high frequency content of an
      image by removing its low frequency content.
    - Don't forget to make sure to clip the pixel values >=0 and <=1. You can
      use torch.clamp().
    - If you want to use images with different dimensions, you should resize
      them in the HybridImageDataset class using torchvision.transforms.
