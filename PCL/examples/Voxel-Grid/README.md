## Downsample by Voxel Grid Filter
The VoxelGrid class that weâ€™re about to present creates a 3D voxel grid (think about a voxel grid as a set of tiny 3D boxes in space) over the input point cloud data. Then, in each voxel (i.e., 3D box), all the points present will be approximated (i.e., downsampled) with their centroid. This approach is a bit slower than approximating them with the center of the voxel, but it represents the underlying surface more accurately.
